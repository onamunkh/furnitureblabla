<p>Potter, designer and author Jonathan Adler launched his namesake brand after leaving his day job to pursue his first love: pottery. In 1993, Barneys bought his collection of pots, and five years later, he opened his first store in Soho. Jonathan’s desire to design all the bits one needs to create a flawlessly chic home led to more and more. Today, we are a design company with retail locations worldwide, a thriving e-commerce site, a full slate of residential and commercial projects, and a wholesale business boasting over 1,000 locations globally. We strive to create luxe and livable interiors that are seriously designed, but don’t take themselves too seriously.And our commitment to impeccable craftsmanship and luxury is reflected in all we do.</p>
